# Introduction

This small site is a collection of **best practices** on security in software development, in the operation of software solutions and also everything around the security of their own home network. 

We have collected the information and recommendations during our work and would like to share them in words. 
Glad to hear our experiences help others. Feel free to have a discussion or share your experiences on GitHub Issues.
